# Vue-Dial

Just a simple project I built for simulating a dial pad in Vue and using the Web Audio API.

There are many things that can probably be better, but as it's just an experiment, I'm fine with it being like this.

## Running

This is just a Vite project. Run `pnpm dev` (after `pnpm install`) for a development server, and use `pnpm build` for
builds.
